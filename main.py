# VARIABLES
x = 5 # read this as "x is assigned 5" or x stores 5
# Not "x equals 5"
#variable stores a value
# a value has a data type 
# a data type defines a range of values
# example: the int data type (short for integer): represent whole numbers
print(type(x)) 
#shows type of variable
x = 5.5
print(x)
print(type(x))
# float data type represents numbers with fractionable parts(AKA decimals)
x = "Hello"
print(x)
print(type(x))
# str or string represents a certain sequence of characters 
x = "5"
print(x)
print(type(x))
# is a string not an integer


# OPERATERS
# PEMDAS
    # parens, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction
# * = multiply
print(4 * 5)
# / floating point division (NORMAL division)
print(5 / 2)
# // integer division (the whole number result of flaoting point division)
print(5 // 2)
# ** exponentiation AKA power
print(2 ** 5) # if you have multiple in an expresion you evaluate right to left

# we can also use the pow() function from the math module 
# need to import math module
# .py file is known as a module or script 

# print 2^5 
# pow function results in a float
print(math.pow(2,5))




# # GETTING USER INPUT
# print("Enter your favourite number")
# fav_number = input()
# print(type(fav_number))
# print("Your favourite number is", fav_number)
# print("Your favourite number doubled is", fav_number * 2, sep = "*")
# print("hello" * 2, end = "~~~~~~~") # sep and end are called keyword arguments
# print("here")
# # REally wnat to double fav number
# # convert fav number string to integer or float
# # this is called type conversion
# fav_number_int = int(fav_number)
# print("Your favourite number doubled is",fav_number_int * 2)



# FORMATTING (decimal numbers)
# few ways to do this
# 1. c style
print(math.pi)
# round to two decimal places
print("%.2f" %(math.pi))
# 2. Pythonic way
